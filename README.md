# Two-Level-Global-Branch-Prediction-on-sDLX-Processor
◦ Conducted extensive research, delving into the intricacies of branch prediction techniques and their significant im-
pact on enhancing processor performance, investigating their strengths, limitations, and their underlying principles.
◦ Implemented a two-level global branch prediction algorithm on the sDLX processor, a simplified version of the DLX
processor, demonstrating a deep understanding of branch prediction concepts and their practical implementation.
